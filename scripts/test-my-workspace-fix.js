 * Test My Workspace Fix for Power BI
 */

console.log('üöÄ MY WORKSPACE FIX - TEST GUIDE')
console.log('================================\n')

console.log('‚úÖ **WHAT I JUST FIXED:**')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Enhanced Power BI service to access "My workspace"')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Added support for /v1.0/myorg/dashboards endpoint')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Added support for /v1.0/myorg/reports endpoint')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Your Reports will now be synced as dashboards')
console.log('‚Ä¢ "My workspace" should appear in future syncs\n')

console.log('üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN:**\n')

console.log('1Ô∏è‚É£ **Test Current Dashboards First**')
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ In your sync dialog, click "Import 2 Dashboards"')
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ This tests that sync functionality works')
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Should import:')
console.log('     - Executive Dashboard')
console.log('     - Operations Report')
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Verify they appear in Dashboard Hub\n')

console.log('2Ô∏è‚É£ **Test My Workspace Fix**')
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ After importing current dashboards')
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Close the sync dialog')
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Click "Sync Dashboards" again')
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Should now show MORE dashboards including:')
console.log('     - Your "My workspace" Reports as dashboards')
console.log('     - Artificial Intelligence Sample')
console.log('     - Corporate Spend')
console.log('     - Revenue Opportunities')
console.log('     - aaaaaaaa (your custom report)\n')

console.log('3Ô∏è‚É£ **Expected Results**')
console.log('   Before fix: Found 2 dashboards')
console.log('   After fix: Found 6+ dashboards (2 + your My workspace content)')
console.log('   All your Reports should now appear as importable dashboards\n')

console.log('üîß **POWER BI API CHANGES MADE:**\n')

console.log('**New Endpoints Added:**')
console.log('‚Ä¢ /v1.0/myorg/dashboards (for My workspace dashboards)')
console.log('‚Ä¢ /v1.0/myorg/reports (for My workspace reports)')
console.log('')

console.log('**Previous Endpoints (still used):**')
console.log('‚Ä¢ /v1.0/myorg/groups (for regular workspaces)')
console.log('‚Ä¢ /v1.0/myorg/groups/{id}/dashboards')
console.log('‚Ä¢ /v1.0/myorg/groups/{id}/reports\n')

console.log('üí° **WHY THIS MATTERS:**')
console.log('‚Ä¢ "My workspace" uses different API endpoints than regular workspaces')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Service principals often can\'t access "My workspace" via groups API')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Direct /myorg/ endpoints work better for personal content')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Now you get both workspace types AND both content types (dashboards + reports)\n')

console.log('üéâ **READY TO TEST:**\n')

console.log('**Step 1:** Import current 2 dashboards (test that sync works)')
console.log('**Step 2:** Sync again (should find your My workspace content)')
console.log('**Step 3:** Import all found dashboards')
console.log('**Step 4:** View them in Dashboard Hub main page')

console.log('\nüéØ **EXPECTED FINAL RESULT:**')
console.log('‚úÖ Executive Dashboard (from Executive Workspace)')
console.log('‚úÖ Operations Report (from Operations Workspace)')
console.log('‚úÖ Artificial Intelligence Sample (from My workspace)')
console.log('‚úÖ Corporate Spend (from My workspace)')
console.log('‚úÖ Revenue Opportunities (from My workspace)')
console.log('‚úÖ aaaaaaaa (from My workspace)')
console.log('‚úÖ Any other My workspace content')

console.log('\nüìû **TROUBLESHOOTING:**')
console.log('If still only 2 dashboards found:')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Check console for API errors')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Try creating actual Dashboard content (not just Reports)')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Verify service principal has Report.Read.All permission')

console.log('\nüöÄ Go test the sync now - should see your My workspace content!')
